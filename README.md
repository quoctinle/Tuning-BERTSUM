The implementation of the baseline "Fine-Tune BERT for Extractive Summarization (Liu et al., 2019)".

Added the different summization layers of K-Mean Clustering stacked on top of the BERT outputs which inspired by "Extractive Text Summarization using Dynamic Clustering and Co-Reference on BERT (Srikanth et al., 2020)".
